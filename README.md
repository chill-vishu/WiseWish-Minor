### Special Thanks

I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to **[InfinityFree.com](https://infinityfree.com)** for providing free hosting services. As a student, I am unable to afford premium, paid domain and hosting services, and InfinityFree.com offers a wonderful platform with free hosting, domain services, and an easy-to-use control panel for managing databases and PHP files.

Their support made it possible for me to host **WiseWish** and bring this project to life without any cost, allowing me to focus on building and refining my website.
